## Summary:
  * Looking at the data not alot of people(40,471 people) dont use Vine and the mojority that dont still gets arround 40% of their reviews 5 stars. this shows that there really is only a 11% increase if the non_vines were to pay for the subscription. Now i think there is more to be read from this data. looking at even 4 stars could maybe even tell us more about the story. Even filtering the data based on the reviews them self could narrow the data.
